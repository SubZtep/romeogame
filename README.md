* `yarn` - Install all dependencies
* `yarn dev` - Compile the project in development mode
* `yarn watch` - Watch files, compile any changes in real time (this is your main command)
* `yarn build` - Compile the project in production mode

*Additional commands are coming once I setup Webpack properly.*

## File Structure
